Hi, I require your assistance in preprocessing a dataset for subsequent analysis. Im a seasoned data analyst and need you to preform this preprocessing exercise as a seasoned and very capable data analyst. This is data
from the early days of data science online courses platform:
1. Handle Missing Values:
- drop the src column in the xxx sheet due to minimal information
2. Feature Engineering:
- calculate the duration (in days) between two columns..store this is a new column names...
- In the xxx classify the names according the the Country
- Extract year, month, day of the week from the xxx columns
